#### two tasks:

- bug fix:

      I created a new event listener that would receive all events without filtering them by class.  
      I registered it exactly as described in the JavaDoc of your API but it does not receive any events.
      I created it to log all events published in the system so I can diagnose a problem in my module. 
    
    

- additional feature, hierarchical events:
    
    - register base class 
    - listen to all sub events as well
